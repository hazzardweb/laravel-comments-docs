## Assets

If you wish to edit something in the JavaScript/Sass files, you have to compile them with [Laravel Mix](http://laravel.com/docs/5.4/mix).

From your terminal, cd into the `laravel-comments` directory and install the npm dependencies:

With npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Or the recommended way, with [Yarn](http://yarnpkg.com/):

```bash
yarn 
```

After you make your changes run `npm run build` to compile the assets.

Each time the assets are compiled you have to run `php artisan vendor:publish --provider=Hazzard\Comments\CommentsServiceProvider --tag=public --force` to override them in your public directory. 

Or you edit the `webpack.mix.js` and change the `publicPath` variable:

```javascript
const publicPath  = '../public/vendor/comments'
```
_Assuming that you have the `laravel-comments` folder in your project root directory._

## Views

If you wish to customize the views run:

```bash
`php artisan vendor:publish --provider=Hazzard\Comments\CommentsServiceProvider --tag=public --force`
```

Then edit them from `resources/views/vendor/comments`.
